I'm absolutely thrilled to share some exciting news with you all. As the founder of MoneySpaces, I couldn't be more delighted to announce a major update, coinciding with the launch of the new iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and watchOS 10. This has been a remarkable journey, filled with challenges, long nights, and relentless dedication from our team. But today, I'm ecstatic to present MoneySpaces 2.0.

## Interactive Widget - A Shortcut to Financial Freedom

Creating the Interactive Widget was a monumental task, but one that we were determined to conquer. Picture this: you can now add transactions to any of your spaces from any category, directly from your Home Screen, thanks to our brand-new Interactive Widget.
