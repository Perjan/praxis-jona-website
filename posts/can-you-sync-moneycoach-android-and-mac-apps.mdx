**Update: The Android app has been deprecated and we are not supporting it anymore.**

No, you currently cannot do that. MoneyCoach on Android and MoneyCoach on iPhone/iPad/Mac/Apple Watch are separate ecosystems/platforms and you cannot sync your data between them. So if you use an Android phone and want to sync the same data with MoneyCoach running on your Mac or the rest of the Apple devices, there is no way to do that. This might change in the future, but for the moment is not possible.

Of course, you can export data as CSV from Android and import that file back on the Mac, iPhone or iPad app, but they cannot sync with each other. They are two separate ecosystems/platforms. On Android, you can access your MoneyCoach profile from any Android device with your login credentials. On iOS, you can sync your data across all your Apple devices that use the same Apple ID.

Also, subscriptions on one ecosystem cannot not carry over on the other ecosystem. So if you are premium on Android, you can't use that same subscription on iOS/iPadOS/macOS and vice-versa.
