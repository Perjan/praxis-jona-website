If you are using MoneyCoach, but want to start fresh from the beginning, this tutorial will show you how to achieve just that.

But before we continue, know that this method means that you will start from zero and all the data that you might have added to MoneyCoach will be deleted.

Here’s how you do that:

- If you are using iCloud to sync your data across all your devices, then deactivate the “Use iCloud” switch in MoneyCoach’s Settings on all your devices

- Delete MoneyCoach iCloud data in your device’s Settings / Apple ID / iCloud Drive / Manage Storage / MoneyCoach – Delete data

- Open MoneyCoach, go to Settings / Data & Sync / Reset data and tap the Reset everything button

- Repeat this on all your devices

- Open MoneyCoach on your main device

- Add an account to the app

- Go to Settings / Data & Sync and turn on the “Use iCloud” switch

- Wait for the indicator to stop spinning in the status bar of the iPhone. Once it ends, it means that the sync has been completed.

- Open the app on the secondary devices and turn the “Use iCloud"

- Wait for one device to complete the sync, then do the other ones.

- Now your devices should be in sync.

- From here start adding all of the information you want to your app and you should see it on the other devices too.

- Enjoy!
