Keeping track of KPIs for an indie developer is extremely important. That means having lots of different Safari tabs open across many analytics tool. Switching back and forth between these tabs, refreshing these pages and scrolling to the exact position where the statistic is displayed wastes time and when you operate on an indie budget, wasting time is a no-go. After careful research, we found out that there was no tool to easily do all of this.

That's why we decided to do something about this and after some tinkering we came up with Decky.
Decky brings a new level of efficiency and convenience to your desktop experience. Gone are the days of constantly switching between tabs or struggling to manage multiple windows. 

Decky has been specifically designed for indie developers, like ourselves, in mind. With Decky, all your important KPIs like Daily or Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU), Active Subscriptions, Churn etc. are there waiting for you to just glance at them.

Open your analytics tool, center each view on top of the chart, graph, statistic etc. you want to see 
and Decky will remember the scroll position on that specific URL. Multiple different grids layout like 1x4 or 2x2 are available to choose from allowing you to have up to 6 different analytics on at all times.
