In the realm of personal finance and wealth-building, different sources of income play distinct roles in shaping one's financial journey. Earned income, passive income, and investment income are three key categories that define how individuals generate money. Each type of income has its own characteristics, benefits, and considerations. Let's dive into the differences between these three essential sources of financial inflow.

## 1. Earned Income: Active Effort Rewarded

Earned income, often referred to as active income, is the money you earn through direct participation in employment or services you provide. It's the most common type of income and includes wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, and commissions.

### Key Characteristics:

- Direct correlation between effort and income: The more you work, the more you earn.
- Regular and predictable: Earned income typically follows a consistent schedule, such as receiving a monthly paycheck.
- Relies on active participation: Your income is tied to your active involvement in your work or business.

## 2. Passive Income: Money While You Sleep

Passive income refers to earnings generated with minimal active effort after an initial setup. It's money that flows in even when you're not directly working. This type of income is often associated with creating income streams from investments, real estate properties, royalties, and businesses that can operate without constant supervision.

## 3. Investment Income: Gains from Financial Ventures

Investment income encompasses the returns earned from various financial investments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, and dividends.

## Choosing the Right Mix for Financial Success
