Every modern business, be it an e-commerce store or a tech company, requires good technology to operate. Technology has re-shaped business operations as we know them and it allowed various companies to simplify workflows and get much more work output. It's safe to say that businesses today cannot survive without proper technology. However, which technology you might need for your company depends on the nature of your business and its size.

Nevertheless, you will most definitely need a computer at least. Choosing a computer for your business isn't as easy as it may sound. There are various models from different manufacturers that have different hardware installed. You must always strive towards obtaining a computer that will meet the needs of your business and its employees. That being said, here are a few tips on how to choose the right computer for your business.

#### Portability

The first thing you must consider is the portability of a computer. Will you have to move it around a lot or will it remain in the office? The main reason portability is important is that you get to make the decision between a desktop or laptop computers. Laptops are quite popular these days and as their name suggests, they can easily be moved around wherever you need them. However, laptops are generally more expensive and more difficult to maintain than desktop computers.

Laptops have a lot of integrated components, which means if something breaks down, it usually has to be replaced along with other parts that are integrated. On the other hand, desktop computers are more reliable as they have more space and more cooling efficiency. If something breaks down on a desktop computer, it can easily be fixed or replaced without compromising other components.  Therefore, if you don't plan on moving your business computers or allowing employees to carry them home with them, you should opt for a desktop rather than a laptop.

#### Storage space

Storage space is essential for businesses. Companies store lots of digital data, which means you need adequate storage space. That's why it's important to choose storage with enough space to suit your business needs. You can choose between a hard disc drive (HDD) or a solid state drive (SSD) or use both. HDD's are mechanical and they break down eventually. On the other hand, SSD are purely electronic, which means they're faster and more reliable, but also more expensive.

For instance, Samsung SSD products have proven to have one of the best price/performance ratios on the market. As far as storage capacity goes, a 500GB drive is quite sufficient to meet most needs. However, if you plan on storing a lot of data, you can choose a drive with 1, 2 or 3TB space to suit your needs. You can always add more drives to desktop computers if need be and replace old ones with new ones. Whereas in laptops, you can replace drives, but not add more of them.

#### Speed

How fast must your computer be to satisfy your business and personal needs? That's the first question to ask yourself before deciding on a purchase. If your employees won't conduct complex daily tasks, then speed doesn't have to be top notch. When determining the speed, you must focus on processor (CPU) and RAM (Random Access Memory) components.

For CPU, choosing either Intel or AMD manufacturer comes down to personal preferences, because there's not much difference in performance between the two. In general, an average processor is a quad-core (four physical cores) with at least 3 GHz frequency. Anything below that may be too slow for today's standards. As for the RAM, 4GB  isn't enough to support most modern Internet and business demands. Today's average is 8GB of RAM, with 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB suited for high-end performance.

#### Display

Graphic display and [resolution](https://www.techdonut.co.uk/blog/13/02/what-screen-resolution-and-why-does-it-matter) are quite important these days. However, for business purposes, having a good resolution and graphics display isn't important unless your company is in the business of graphic design and similar services. When determining the resolution and graphics display, you should look at the computer screen or monitor and graphics card component or GPU. Most modern monitors and laptop display screens support full-HD resolution or 1980x1080p.

Some even go for 4K resolution or 3840x2160p. As for the GPU, here you have two choices of manufacturers, Nvidia and AMD. For basic business purposes, choosing an integrated GPU from either manufacturer is a good choice. For more advanced features and purposes, Nvidia offers better performing GPU's for a higher price than AMD counterparts. Still, it comes down to preferences and needs.

There are various options when it comes to picking a computer for your business. In the end, the hardware you need comes down to your business needs. Hardware will determine the performance of your computers. If your computers are too slow to match your needs, you'll have to buy new ones. That's why it's important not to rush the decision and take your time before purchasing a computer.
