Hi all, Krist here. Here's what's new in this update:

- Improved the Apple Watch app. Now it should sync the data with the phone and vice versa without any problem.
- Improved the localization for some languages
- Fixed a rare bug that caused a crash when editing categories
- Other minor bug fixes and improvements

We are preparing the big fall update for MoneyCoach. If you want to see something in the app, a new feature, new icons etc. now it's the time to submit that request.

Thanks,  
MoneyCoach team
