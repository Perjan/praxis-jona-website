## 1. No Usage Data is Displayed
If you're not seeing any usage data on your Screen Time dashboard, consider the following steps:

- Check Settings:
Ensure that Screen Time is enabled in your device settings. Go to "Settings" > "Screen Time" and ensure it's turned on.
- Update iOS:
Outdated software can lead to compatibility issues. Make sure your device is running the latest version of iOS.
- Restart Your Device:
Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve minor glitches. Turn off and then restart your device.

## 2. Limits Aren't Enforced
If your set app limits or downtime aren't being enforced, follow these steps:

- Review Settings:
Double-check that you've correctly set up the app limits and downtime schedules.
- Check Time Zone Settings:
Ensure your device's time zone settings are accurate. Incorrect time zone settings could affect the enforcement of limits.
- Recreate Limits:
If the issue persists try deleting and recreating the limits. Sometimes, this can resolve underlying configuration problems.

## 3. Incorrect Data Reporting
In some cases, you might notice that Screen Time is reporting inaccurate data. Here's what you can do:

- Sync iCloud:
Make sure iCloud is properly synced across your devices. Sometimes, discrepancies can occur if data isn't being properly synchronized.
- Reset Screen Time:
If the issue persists, you can reset Screen Time by going to "Settings" > "Screen Time" > "Scroll Down" > "Reset Statistics." Note that this will erase all your usage data.

## 4. Unable to Access Content & Privacy Passcode
If you've forgotten your Screen Time passcode or are having trouble accessing the Content & Privacy restrictions, consider these steps:

- Reset Passcode:
If you've forgotten your Screen Time passcode, you can reset it by going to "Settings" > "Screen Time" > "Change Screen Time Passcode" > "Forgot Passcode?" You'll need to reset your device to factory settings, though, so be sure to back up your data first.
- Contact Apple Support:
If you encounter issues with Content & Privacy restrictions, reaching out to Apple Support is recommended, as they can provide guidance tailored to your situation.
