In 2020 **MoneyCoach** proved to be **extremely useful and crucial** to hundreds and thousands of our users helping them improve their financial habits by cutting on useless spendings and putting that money to work somewhere else.  
  
We know this because we talked to a lot of you this year.

- We are super proud of how much MoneyCoach grew this year in terms of reach, users, and engagement
- We are super proud of how many times MoneyCoach was featured on the front page of the App Store by Apple
- We are super proud of how MoneyCoach was showcased on Apple’s WWDC20 Keynote and on Apple’s official website
- We are super proud that we have users who have been with us and supporting us for more than 4 years

We did **a lot of things** in 2020 and I think it's better if we show you, instead of just talking about them. That's why we prepared this cool presentation with the highlights of the year, major updates, and new features we introduced in 2020 that had a **massive impact** on improving the MoneyCoach experience. Tap the image to check out the presentation.

Thanks for making 2020 our best year yet! Here's to a greater 2021 🍻🥳🎉
