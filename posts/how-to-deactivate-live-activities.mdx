Live Activities is mainly a lock screen feature that helps you stay on top of things happening in real time. When you add a new transaction in MoneyCoach, the Live Activity appears on your Lock Screen where you can also see the total spending on that category / subcategory (soon) and a comparison to the previous period.

If for some reason, you don't want this great new feature, you can just easily deactivate it and here's how to do it.

Just go to your iPhone Settings (not MoneyCoachâ€™s Settings), scroll until you find MoneyCoach, tap it and then just turn off the Live Activities switch.
