I'm writing this on Aug 6th, 2023 and I'm already late with this diary entry. I'm gonna keep it short and sweet (or bitter, at least for me).

## New app, who dis?
I had an idea I wanted to do since the day I saw the Dynamic Island on iPhone 14 Pro. Seeing my friends and family how much time they spend on socials, I thought it would be a great idea to reflect that in realtime.
That is why I created the new app, Screen Time Realtime. It's an app that tracks your usage and gives you a score based on how much time you spend on it. It's a great way to see how much time you spend on social media and how much time you could spend doing something else. I'm really proud of it and I hope it will help people to be more mindful of their time.
The app is live on the App Store. Download it now and let me know what you think!


## Is this diary really worth it?
The date is Aug 7th and I haven't written a single line for this diary entry until now.
I could name several reasons, but the truth is that I just didn't feel like it. I was busy with other things and I didn't want to spend my time writing about my life.
Seeing how much time it takes me to write about my app business and not hearing back from you, it looks like I should stop writing these diaries. Even though the email open rates are stellar, the replies are non-existent. I don't know if you are reading these or not, but I'm not sure if I should continue writing them.
My main goal was to establish a communication channel with you, dear reader, but it looks like I failed. I will give it a few more weeks and see what happens.

Talk to you soon,
Perjan
