## Utilizing Your Apple Card Statements

- Review and Track Spending: Take the time to review your statements regularly. Check for any unauthorized transactions or errors and report them to Apple Card support. Use the transaction details to categorize and track your spending, helping you make informed decisions about your finances.
- Budgeting and Financial Planning: Your statements provide a comprehensive overview of your expenses, allowing you to create a budget and set financial goals. Use this information to identify areas where you can cut back or adjust your spending habits.
- Timely Payments: Your statement indicates the payment due date and the minimum payment required. Aim to make at least the minimum payment by the due date to avoid late fees and maintain a positive payment history. Consider setting up automatic payments to ensure timely payments.
- Digital Recordkeeping: Save or download your statements for future reference and recordkeeping. This is particularly useful for tax purposes or when you need to review past transactions.
