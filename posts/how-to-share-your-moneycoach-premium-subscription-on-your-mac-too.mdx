If you subscribe to MoneyCoach Premium on your iPhone, you will be premium on your iPad and Mac too. Currently, it is basically "one premium to rule them all". Most of the time this process is flawless and fully automatic and you don't have to do anything, you will be premium on your Mac too. However, sometimes you will need to check or do some things to ensure that your iPhone and iPad can talk to your Mac and share the subscription. Here's what to do:

**Make sure iCloud Drive is active**

1. On iPhone and iPad:
    - Open the iPhone/iPad Settings app
    - Tap on your Profile/Apple ID
    - Tap on iCloud
    - Scroll down until you find iCloud Drive and turn the switch ON
    - Scroll down until you find MoneyCoach and turn the switch ON
    - Now your devices can talk to each other
2. On Mac:
    - Open System Preferences
    - Click on Apple ID
    - Check the iCloud Drive box to turn it ON
    - Click the "Options" button in the iCloud Drive cell
    - Make sure the MoneyCoach box is checked
    - Now all your devices can talk to each other

Now, force quit MoneyCoach on your iPhone, iPad and Mac and open them again. If everything went right, they should all be premium. If not, try a couple of times as iTunes might need a while to validate your purchase. Also, note that iTunes might be down or experiencing problems in your region. If it asks you to enter your Apple ID and password, fill those in. If it still doesn't work, try the following steps.

**Make sure you don't have any In-app Purchase restrictions**

1. On iPhone and iPad
    - Open the iPhone/iPad Settings app
    - Tap on Screen Time
    - Tap on Content & Privacy Restrictions
    - If you don't want any restrictions at all, just turn the main switch OFF
    - If you need the switch to be ON:
        - Tap iTunes & App Store Purchases
        - Tap In-app Purchases
        - Select Allow
    - Now your iPhone and iPad share their In-app Purchases
2. On your Mac
    - Open System Preferences
    - Click on Screen Time
    - Click on Content & Privacy Restrictions
    - If you don't want any restrictions at all, just turn the main switch OFF
    - If you need the switch to be ON:
        - Click on Stores
        - Check the Allow on iOS - In-app Purchases box
    - Now your iPhone, iPad and Mac can share their In-app Purchases

Again, force quit MoneyCoach on your iPhone, iPad and Mac and open them again. If everything went right, they should all be premium. If not, try a couple of times as iTunes might need a while to validate your purchase.

After your subscription becomes available on your Mac too, you can activate use iCloud to sync data across your Apple devices. Here's a guide on how to correctly do that - [tap here](/how-to-activate-cloud-sync/).

In some rare cases, you might have downloaded the app with an Apple ID, then changed the Apple ID on the device to another one and subscribed to MoneyCoach Premium. We don't know what happens in this case and Apple doesn't really know what happens on this case. If you decide to change the Apple ID, it would be advisable to delete the apps and download them again, so you don't go through that whole conundrum.

If you have subscribed to premium on both your iPhone and your Mac, meaning two separate subscriptions, you won't have to deal with any of these problems. We are a small team and since the iPhone/iPad and Mac apps are two separate apps and require a lot of dev time, that additional subscription is really helpful. But since we are all for that "one subscription to rule them all" mantra, you can cancel the Mac subscription, make sure your devices can all talk to each other and you should be good to go.

If it still doesn't work after doing all this troubleshooting, please get in touch with our support and we will see what we can do to help you.
