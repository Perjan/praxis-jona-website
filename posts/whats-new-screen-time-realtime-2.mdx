Hello everyone,

As the founder of Screen Time Realtime, I'm absolutely thrilled to announce a significant update that coincides with the launch of the new iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and watchOS 10. This journey has been nothing short of challenging, but it's a labor of love, and I can't wait for you to experience all that's new in Screen Time Realtime.

## Interactive Widget - Your Daily Insight at a Glance

Creating the Interactive Widget was a real feat. Imagine being able to check your daily app usage and the number of times you've opened them right from your Home Screen! It's like having your digital habits right in front of you.

You can even personalize it by selecting the apps you want to monitor with a simple tap and hold. This widget puts your screen time insights at your fingertips.

## New Customization Options - Making it Yours

We've worked hard to give you more control over the app's look and feel. Now, you can change the colors of the stopwatch and counter in the Dynamic Island and Live Activity.
