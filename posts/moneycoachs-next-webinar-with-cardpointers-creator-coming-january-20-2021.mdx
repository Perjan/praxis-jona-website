Hello everyone! Today, we are excited to announce a new "Money Talk" financial wellbeing webinar on January 20th, 2021. Personal and exclusive, only 40 seats.

In this Money Talk with MoneyCoach.ai, Emmanuel Crouvisier will explain how to get more credit card points earning you thousands of dollars and free flights!

Most people use credit cards for purchases, but very few realize the full potential of having the right set of credit cards, and what a difference that can make each year. Not only can you earn a considerable amount of cash back and/or points every day just by using the right card for the purchases you're already making, but you can also earn thousands more by signing up for specific cards at various times throughout the year, all while increasing your credit score, allowing you to save even more. 

Banks purposely make the credit card world difficult to navigate, but with a few key tips and an app like CardPointers, you can put a great credit card strategy on auto-pilot which can easily add up to thousands of dollars per year.
