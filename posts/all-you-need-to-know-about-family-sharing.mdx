Family Sharing has been one of the most requested features by the users. We're glad to announce that it is finally available in MoneyCoach!

In this guide we will dive deep and learn all about this new powerful feature. Let's start.

### What is Family Sharing in MoneyCoach?

Family Sharing allows you to share and sync data across multiple users that use different Apple IDs. Basically you can now share your data with your wife, husband or partner and have one unified experience where you can see your shared accounts, budgets, goals, transactions etc.

Keep in mind that Family Sharing is a Premium feature.

### How does it work?

To understand better how this works, let's explore some scenarios.

#### Scenario 1 - Existing User and New User

**Existing User**
- The existing user has been using MoneyCoach and has their own data history.
- They have the option to enable Family Sharing and invite a neew user to join.

**New User**
- The new user is new to MoneyCoach and does not have any data history.
- They receive an invitation from the existing user to join the Family Sharing group.

**Syncing Data**
- Once the new user accepts the invitation and joins the Family Sharing group, their app will sync with the existing user's data.
- The new user will be able to see all the financial data from the previous user, including transactions, accounts, budgets, goals, categories, pretty much everything.
- Both users now have access to the shared data and can modify it as they wish. Any modifications made by either user will be reflected in the shared data visible to both parties.

#### Scenario 2 - Two Existing Users

**User A and User B**
- User A and User B are both existing users of MoneyCoach, each with their own data history.
- They decide to activate Family Sharing and merge their datasets into one.

**Merging Data**
- Once both users agree to activate Family Sharing, their respective datasets will be merged into a single shared dataset.
- The app will combine transactions, accounts, budgets, goals, categories, pretty much everything from User A and User B into a unified view.
- Both users now have access to the shared dataset and can modify it collaboratively and any changes made will be reflected in real-time for both parties.

These two scenarios cover pretty much everything about how Family Sharing works in MoneyCoach.

### How To Activate Family Sharing

1. Since this is a Premium feature, you and all of the other users you invite need to be Premium users. If you or any family member has bought a Family Plan subscription, all of the family members will become Premium after their restore purchases. Learn more about this [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201088).

2. In Settings, go to Data & Sync

3. Tap the Share button in the Family Sync section

4. In the Share view, tap Share with more people button

5. Find your family member and send them the link via one of the available methods

6. That's it. Once they accept your invitation, the syncing will start and after a few moments both of you will have one shared MoneyCoach view.

### Things to know

Although we merge and sync pretty much everything into one unified dataset when you are in Family Sharing with other users, some customizing options are individual. 

For example, each user can separately select to show or hide any accounts from their Overview card and Net Worth. Here's a [guide](/guides/how-to-show-hide-accounts) on how to do that.
