Family Sharing has been one of the most requested features by the users. We're glad to announce that it is finally available in MoneyCoach!

In this guide we will dive deep and learn all about this new powerful feature. Let's start.

### What is Family Sharing in MoneyCoach?

Family Sharing allows you to share and sync data across multiple users that use different Apple IDs. Basically you can now share your data with your wife, husband or partner and have one unified experience where you can see your shared accounts, budgets, goals, transactions etc.

Keep in mind that Family Sharing is a Premium feature.

### How To Activate Family Sharing

1. Since this is a Premium feature, you and all of the other users you invite need to be Premium users. If you or any family member has bought a Family Plan subscription, all of the family members will become Premium after their restore purchases. Learn more about this [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201088).

2. In Settings, go to Data & Sync

3. If the "Use iCloud" toggle is ON, you can skip this step. If not, activate the "Use iCloud" switch and wait for the initial sync to complete.

4. Turn on "Use Family Sync" toggle

5. Once the share view appears, here you can choose to invite your partner, family member or whoever you want.

6. Tap the "Done" button once you have sent the invites.

7. Wait for the final sync to complete

8. That's it. You have done your part. Once whoever you invited accept your invitation, the syncing will start and after a few moments both of you will have one shared MoneyCoach view.

### How does it work?

Family Sharing in MoneyCoach allows users to share and sync their data with multiple users with different Apple IDs. What this means is that when an user activates Family Sharing and sends an invite to another user, when this invitation is accepted, their data will get merged into one.

The app will combine transactions, accounts, budgets, goals, categories, pretty much everything into one unified dataset. All users who are part of this Family Sharing instance have access to the shared dataset and can modify it collaboratively and any changes made will be reflected in real-time for all parties.

### Things to know

Although we merge and sync pretty much everything into one unified dataset when you are in Family Sharing with other users, some customizing options are individual. 

For example, each user can separately select to show or hide any accounts from their Overview card and Net Worth. Here's a [guide](/guides/how-to-show-hide-accounts) on how to do that.

Another important thing to mention is that when you activate the "Use iCloud" and "Use Family Sharing" toggles, MoneyCoach will also make a manual backup file containing all the data that is present in your app locally at that point in time. You can find this backup in the MoneyCoach folder in your iCloud Drive when exploring via the Files app.
