As I went on a redesigned the entire App Shortcuts in [MoneyCoach](/), I realized that I need to localize the App Intents. I mean, it’s a no brainer, but I didn’t think about it until I had to do it.

App Intents use a new more intelligent way of handling localizations. You need to use the [LocalizedStringResource](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/localizedstringresource?changes=_10).
The documentation is a bit lacking, but I managed to figure it out after wasting/investing/spending 2 days of trial and error.
Looking forward to save you time with this simple tutorial.

## How to localize App Intents
1. First you need to use LocalizedStringResource.
2. Second you have Xcode generate the strings file for you. Just go over to Product --> Export Localizations and select the language you want to localize. Xcode will generate the strings file for you.  **Except that it doesn't.**

## Solution
So the trick is to go over to your project build settings or target build settings, find the **"Use Compiler To Extract Swift Strings"** and set it to `Yes`.

That's it. Go ahead and repeat step 2.

So this is now easy it is to have Xcode generate the strings for LocalizedStringResource. Now let's see how to use it.
