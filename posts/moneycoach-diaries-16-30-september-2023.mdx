Hello there,
it is me again. It feels like we spoke yesterday. Well, at least I spoke to you. You didn't reply (excluding the one who did. ðŸ’Œ). I am not mad. I know you don't have time.

## MoneyCoach gets featured worldwide
With the release of iOS 17, we were fortunate enough to be featured in the App Store as one of the best budgeting apps for iOS 17. Although we are lucky enough to have it experienced many times now, it is always a great feeling to see your app featured in the App Store. It never gets old.
Needless to say that the downloads skyrocketed. We are talking about 10x the usual downloads. It was a great feeling. I couldn't stop checking RevenueCat's dashboard. I was like a kid in a candy store. I was so happy that I even bought a new MacBook Air 13-inch with M2. Probably the best device I have ever owned.

## MoneyCoach gets featured on TechCrunch
This was a first for us. We have been featured on many websites, but never on TechCrunch. It was amazing to see our app among other indie friends and great apps.

## MoneyCoach gets some bugs on Apple Watch

## Is it too late to TikTok?

## Social Media offensive

Follow me on [Twit... sorry, X](https://twitter.com/perjanDuro) to learn more.

## Have you meet my other apps?
You know I love to experiment with ideas and create apps that solve my own problems, right? If not, then here are two apps for you.
- [**Screen Time Realtime**](/blog/control-and-limit-social-media-with-screen-time-realtime-stopwatch-timer)
- [**Decky Dashboard**](/blog/introducing-decky-indie-app-developer-dashboard)

Both of them are free. Take a look at the articles I attached, if you want to understand what they are and why I made them.

That would be it for today.
Thanks for reading this far and for being part of my journey. 
Let me know your thoughts on Twitter or by replying to this email.

Love,
Perjan
