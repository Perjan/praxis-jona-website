In this tutorial, we are going to learn how we can check the true cost of subscriptions. You might be surprised when you see how much your Disney Plus or Netflix or Spotify premium has cost you. This puts things into perspective and you can make better financial decisions based on it.

To find out how much you have paid for a subscription this year, last year, or in total, we are going to use the Subscription Insights report in [MoneyCoach](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id989642198?pt=118449936&ct=website&mt=8). Open the Subscription Insights and select the subscription you want to check out. This way you can easily find out how much Disney Plus or Hulu has cost you this year, last year, or in total.

This report is extremely useful as it allows you to understand the true cost of your [subscriptions](/how-to-add-a-repeating-transaction-transfer/) and who knows, maybe you will decide to cancel a subscription that you might not use and save some money in the process.
