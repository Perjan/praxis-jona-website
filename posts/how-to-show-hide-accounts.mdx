In MoneyCoach you can choose which accounts you want to be calculated or not in the Overview cards calculation. You might want to hide an account from the Overview or you might want to glance at the summary of a specific account. It is all about choice. Savings Accounts are automatically not calculated on the Overview cards, this way you are not inclined to spend that money.

**Hereâ€™s how to do it:**

1. Scroll to the end of the Overview I _Alternatively go to Settings / Overview / Summary Cards / Show hide accounts_
2. Tap the "Edit" button
3. Tap on "Summary Cards"
4. Tap on "Show/hide accounts"
5. Here you can select which account you want to be calculated and which not
6. Once you go back to the Overview, you will see that the Summary Cards have changed to reflect what your choice
7. If you add a new transaction to an account which is not being calculated, the Summary Cards will not be affected
8. Congratulations, now you know how to show/hide accounts on the Overview cards
