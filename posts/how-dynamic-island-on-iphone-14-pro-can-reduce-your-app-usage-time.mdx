Here is how Dynamic Island on the iPhone 14 Pro can help reduce your app usage time:

## Quick access to notifications and updates
Dynamic Island allows apps to show live updates, notifications and information without having to open the app. This means users can quickly check things like messages, calendar events, sports scores etc. directly from the island.

## Interactive music and podcast controls
Apps like Apple Music and Spotify can display song/episode information along with playback controls in Dynamic Island. Users don't have to leave their current app to pause, skip or change tracks.

## Glanceable navigation guidance
Maps apps displaying turn-by-turn navigation can show the next direction in Dynamic Island. Drivers can keep their eyes on the road instead of repeatedly launching the maps app.

## At-a-glance timers and countdowns
Apps offering timers, stopwatches, cooking timers etc. can show updated times directly on the Dynamic Island instead of requiring the app to be open.

We made an app that uses Dynamic Island to do this specific thing. It tracks your app usage in realtime and displays a stopwatch in the Dynamic Island at all times, making you more mindful about how much real time you are "wasting" in an app. Download [**Screen Time Realtime**](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6452629146?pt=118449936&ct=articles&mt=8) and take back your time!

## Quick access to recent and suggested apps
Dynamic Island makes app switching faster by providing direct access to recently used and intelligently suggested apps without additional launches.

## Background app functionality without interrupting workflow
Apps can perform tasks like file uploads, downloads, backups etc. while remaining in the background accessible through Dynamic Island.

## Glanceable live updates
Apps providing live scores, stats, news updates etc. remove the need to repeatedly open them to check for new information displayed on Dynamic Island.
