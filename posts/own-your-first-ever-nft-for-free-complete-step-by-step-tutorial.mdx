NFT are all the rage right now and it's something everyone needs to pay attention to. "But what are NFTs?" you might ask or "How do I buy one?" or "How do they even work?".

NFT are "non-fungible token" more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different.

At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain also supports these NFTs, which store extra information that makes them work differently from, say, an ETH coin. This is how far I am going even try to explain the whole NFT market, cause I, and I probably guess many of you, am not really an expert in this matter.

However, David Minns, founder of [Mini Mutants](https://minimutants.com/my-first-ever-nft/), is one. He has extensive experience in software-based customer support during his time in engineering, supporting designers of sewage pumps to rocket scientists. He will be able to guide you through every step, making it effortless and enjoyable and in the end, you might own your first ever NFT completely for free. I say might cause he is giving away a total of 100 NFT and they are going fast.
