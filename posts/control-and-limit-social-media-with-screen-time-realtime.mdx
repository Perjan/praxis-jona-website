Today we are really excited to introduce to you our newest app, Screen Time Realtime. 

This idea started a while ago during an “interesting” argument with my wife. I was something like “Can you please stop scrolling endlessly through Instagram and watch the movie? You have already spent like 1 hour scrolling so far”. And you know how tiny innocent arguments like these go “No, I haven’t spent 1 hour”, “You always say things like this”… etc. 

That’s when this idea popped in my mind, to use Shortcuts Automation to track how much time my wife spends on Instagram.

Screen Time Realtime is the ultimate tool for those who want to take control of their app usage and develop healthier digital habits.

Download [Screen Time Realtime](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/screen-time-realtime/id6452629146) now to track and limit your social media usage.

Screen Time Realtime uses Shortcuts Automation to toggle a stopwatch whenever you open one of your configured apps (TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram...) or any games (Clash of Clans, Marvel Snap, Genshin Impact).

### Enhanced Self-Awareness
By tracking your app usage, you gain a clearer understanding of how you spend your time on your device, leading to better self-awareness and more intentional behavior.
### Improved Productivity
Identifying time-wasting apps allows you to reclaim those minutes and redirect them toward more productive tasks or meaningful activities.
### Digital Well-being
Developing healthy app usage habits promotes better overall well-being by reducing stress, anxiety, and the feeling of being constantly connected.
### Better Time Management
With insights into your app usage patterns, you can allocate your time more efficiently and strike a balance between screen time and other aspects of life.

Tracking app usage encourages a more conscious and mindful approach to technology, where you use your devices with purpose rather than impulsively.
### Family-Friendly Monitoring
Screen Time Realtime is also suitable for parents who want to monitor and manage their children's app usage in a supportive and responsible manner.
