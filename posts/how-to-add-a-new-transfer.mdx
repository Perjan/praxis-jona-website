Things to keep in mind:

- Transfers between Normal and Savings accounts will count as Expense transactions and be reflected on the Summary Cards to help you understand that that amount of money is "locked", not meant to be spent as it is already considered spent

- Transfers between Savings and Normal accounts will count as Income transactions and be reflected on the Summary Cards to help you understand that that amount of money was "locked" from being spent before, now it's yours to spend

- The same things are true for deposits to Goals
