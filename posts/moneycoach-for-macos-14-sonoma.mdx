macOS 14 Sonoma is out and MoneyCoach is ready to go, with two great improvements for your widgets: theyâ€™re interactive and available on your desktop. ðŸ™Œ

The interactive widgets that recently came to iPhone and iPad are now available on your Mac. This means you can directly add a new transaction to any of your categories from any of your accounts without having to open MoneyCoach.

In the past, widgets were confined to your Notification Center. Now you can place them right on your desktop.

To add a widget, simply right-click on your desktop, choose Edit Widgets, and search for MoneyCoach in the gallery. If you can't see the new Interactive Widget in the list, switch from **On This Mac** to **From iPhone**.

Also note that you can change how the widgets look by going to **System Settings â†’ Desktop & Dock â†’ Widgets â†’ Widget Style**.

Donâ€™t forget that you need update to macOS 14 Sonoma before you can try the new widgets. We hope you enjoy them!
