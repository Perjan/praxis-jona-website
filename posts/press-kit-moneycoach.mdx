## The MoneyCoach Story

MoneyCoach was created by Perjan Duro to solve his own problems with personal finance management. Perjan was losing money, because of not knowing where the money was going and where to channelize the energy for earning more and spending less.

Let alone the fact that keeping track of so many accounts, was a total waste of time.

Millions of freelancers, small startups and normal people with more that 3 accounts (credit card, savings account, debit accounts, etc), are facing this issue every day. They need a fast an easy way to track their accounts and new techniques to make more money.

We took a look and tried several app during a one year period, but the current solutions were either oversimplified or cluttered and buggy. The apps that were above the crowd, needed always extra payments to unlock even a simple chart.

Motivated by this, on 2014 we crafted MoneyCoach ‚Äî The easiest personal finance tracker & trainer app.

During the last year, MoneyCoach improved vastly, thanks to the community around it and to the users which suggest features that make their lives easier. Now it is ready for the big show, always by staying true to its mission: **Helping people achieve financial freedom!**
