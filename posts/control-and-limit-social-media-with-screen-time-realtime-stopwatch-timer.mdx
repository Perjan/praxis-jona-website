Today we are really excited to introduce to you our newest app, Screen Time Realtime.

Download [Screen Time Realtime](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/screen-time-realtime/id6452629146) now to track and limit your social media usage.

### 💥 How it started
I got into a big fight with my wife last month, because of social media apps 💬💥. So I made an app that uses Dynamic Island and Shortcuts to display screen time in realtime. **After one week of usage, her screen time is down by 4 hours.**

I was something like “Can you please stop scrolling endlessly through Instagram and watch the movie? You have already spent like 1 hour scrolling so far”. And you know how tiny innocent arguments like these go “No, I haven’t spent 1 hour”, “You always say things like this”… etc. 

### 🤖 Turning Frustration into Innovation
Fed up with the impact of social media on relationships, I harnessed the power of Shortcuts Automation to craft a simple solution. 🛠️ The result? An app that effortlessly tracks screen time and transforms digital habits! 💪

### 📈 The Transformative Power of Data
Once the app was in action, the real magic happened! ✨ After just ONE week of using Screen Time Realtime, my wife's social media consumption dropped by a staggering 4 hours! 📊👏 And that's just the beginning...

### 💑 From Strain to Stronger Bonds
With reduced screen time, we reconnected like never before. ❤️🔗 The app not only saved precious hours but also rekindled our connection. It's not just an app; it's a relationship revolution! 🌟

### 🌐 Empowering Relationships Everywhere:
But wait, there's more! 🌍 I'm thrilled to share that this app isn't just for us, it's for EVERYONE! 🙌 Whether you're dating, married, or anything in between, this app is a game-changer. Tag your partner and spread the love! 💞

Now some more information about the app and the benefits you can gain from using it.

Screen Time Realtime is the ultimate tool for those who want to take control of their app usage and develop healthier digital habits.

Screen Time Realtime uses Shortcuts Automation to toggle a stopwatch whenever you open one of your configured apps (TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram...) or any games (Clash of Clans, Marvel Snap, Genshin Impact).

### Enhanced Self-Awareness
By tracking your app usage, you gain a clearer understanding of how you spend your time on your device, leading to better self-awareness and more intentional behavior.
### Improved Productivity
Identifying time-wasting apps allows you to reclaim those minutes and redirect them toward more productive tasks or meaningful activities.
### Digital Well-being
Developing healthy app usage habits promotes better overall well-being by reducing stress, anxiety, and the feeling of being constantly connected.
### Better Time Management
With insights into your app usage patterns, you can allocate your time more efficiently and strike a balance between screen time and other aspects of life.
