This is an ongoing article where I will document what happened in the last 2 weeks.

## May 16, 2023
I spent major part of the day focusing on invoicing and bookkeeping. For such a small company you would wonder how much shitty bookkeeping you have to do. I am not even talking about the taxes. I am talking about the day to day bookkeeping. I am not a fan of it, but it has to be done. My bookkeeper and tax advisor needs all invoices by tomorrow.

I also sat down together with Krist and developed the structure that will support localizing the most important pages of our website. Why are we doing this, you might ask?
Well here are three arguments:
1. We want to be able to assist our users in their native language
2. We want to rank higher in the search engines
3. We want to be able to see if we can get more customers from other countries

We are starting with the Italian language. We will see how it goes and then we will decide if we will continue with other languages.

Italian localization finished. After testing the website, I deployed it in an instant. Thanks God for Vercel. Now let's wait for Google to crawl it and see if that will impact our search position in Italy.
