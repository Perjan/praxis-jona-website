This is an ongoing article where I will document what happened in the last 2 weeks.
Apparently this is gonna be a long one. So grab a coffee and enjoy the read. Or better grab a coffee dispenser because it is a long one.

## May 16, 2023
I spent major part of the day focusing on invoicing and bookkeeping. For such a small company you would wonder how much shitty bookkeeping you have to do. I am not even talking about the taxes. I am talking about the day to day bookkeeping. I am not a fan of it, but it has to be done. My bookkeeper and tax advisor needs all invoices by tomorrow.

I also sat down together with Krist and developed the structure that will support localizing the most important pages of our website. Why are we doing this, you might ask?
Well here are three arguments:
1. We want to be able to assist our users in their native language
2. We want to rank higher in the search engines
3. We want to be able to see if we can get more customers from other countries

We are starting with the Italian language. We will see how it goes and then we will decide if we will continue with other languages.

Italian localization finished. After testing the website, I deployed it in an instant. Thanks God for Vercel. Now let's wait for Google to crawl it and see if that will impact our search position in Italy.

Surfing the waves of optimism, we decided to localizing the website in German as well. I was lazy to localize it manually. So I went on and used DeepL. The first pass was alright. Now some tweaks and there we have it.
Check it out here and let me know what you think. Good or bad. Here is the [link](/de).

Then I got a message again from my bookkeeper saying that there are some other invoices that she couldn't find. I have to manually search through all my emails and web accounts to find them and match them.
I am slowly thinking about creating an AI assistant that will do this for me. If you are a freelancer or run a small company, please tell me if this is a problem for you as well? Let me know.

## Things nobody asked for
If you are already familiar with this occurence throughout my diaries, you know what I am talking about. If not, let me explain. I am talking about the things that I do, but nobody asked me to do them. I just do them because I think they are important. And I think they are important because I am the founder of this company and I have to make sure that everything is running smoothly.
To tell you the truth, we thought about this with Krist. And now here it is.
I added a simple language switcher to the footer and mobile menu of the website. It is not perfect, but it does the job. I will improve it in the future. But for now, it is good enough.
