Here are some ways to use Shortcuts and Live Activities on iOS to improve digital well-being:

- Set up a bedtime shortcut that automatically turns on Do Not Disturb, locks the screen, and opens a meditation app at a scheduled time each night. This makes it easier to disconnect before bed.

We made an app that uses Shortcuts Automation to track your app usage in realtime and displays a stopwatch as a Live Activities at all times, making you more mindful about how much real time you are "wasting" in an app. Donwload [**Screen Time Realtime**](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6452629146?pt=118449936&ct=articles&mt=8) and take back your time!

- Create a "Focus Mode" shortcut that activates a specific Focus profile with one tap. For example, a "Work" shortcut that enables the Work focus.
- Use shortcuts to automatically start a screen time limit when launching certain distracting apps like social media. Live Activities can then show the countdown.
- Make a "Break Reminder" shortcut that notifies you to take periodic breaks from your device using Live Activities. It can suggest quick exercises or remind you to drink water.
- Set up a "Wind Down" shortcut in the evening that fades phone colors, starts relaxing music/podcasts, and shows remaining time using Live Activities.
- Create shortcuts for "Quiet Time" on weekends that silences notifications and shows allowed app times on Live Activities.
- Use shortcuts to start a meditation timer and show its progress on Live Activities whenever you feel stressed during the day.
- Set focus modes to automatically start during work/school hours based on calendar events using shortcuts.
- Create a "Focus Report" shortcut to review weekly screen time stats of each focus mode using Live Activities.
