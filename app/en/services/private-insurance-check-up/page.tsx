                        <p className="mt-2 text-lg leading-8 text-primaryLighter">We offer two tailored check-up packages optimally designed to meet your individual needs.</p>

                        <p className="mt-2 text-lg leading-8 text-primaryLighter">The standard public health examination, which is covered every three years from the age of 35, only includes basic tests such as blood glucose, cholesterol, and urine analysis. From our medical perspective, this is not sufficient to identify all relevant health risks in a timely manner.</p>

                        <p className="mt-2 text-lg leading-8 text-primaryLighter">Our enhanced preventive examinations meaningfully supplement these basic services. They include, among other things, a detailed examination of your cardiovascular system (e.g., resting and stress ECG), vascular examinations such as stroke checks, and internal cancer screening through ultrasound examinations of the abdominal organs and thyroid.</p>

                        <p className="mt-2 text-lg leading-8 text-primaryLighter">Some services are covered by your public health insurance, and we're happy to provide individual advice about the additional examinations. Please speak to our practice team â€“ together we'll find the right preventive package for you.</p>
