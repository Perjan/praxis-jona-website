                                <p className="mt-2 text-lg leading-8 text-primaryLighter">The ultrasound examination of the abdomen is used for diagnosing and monitoring various conditions. This method allows for the assessment of the size, structure, and position of abdominal organs such as the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, prostate, lymph nodes, abdominal aorta, bladder, and intestines. For optimal results, it is recommended to fast before the examination to avoid gas interference and ensure a filled gallbladder.</p>

                                <p className="mt-2 text-lg leading-8 text-primaryLighter">Thyroid sonography assesses the size, structure, and potential abnormalities such as nodules or cysts in the thyroid gland. This examination provides immediate results and is a crucial tool for diagnosing and monitoring thyroid conditions, including thyroid nodules and thyroiditis.</p>

                                <p className="mt-2 text-lg leading-8 text-primaryLighter">The carotid duplex examination is a painless, non-invasive ultrasound procedure used to examine the carotid arteries. It evaluates both the structure of the vessels and blood flow. This test helps identify narrowing or plaques in the carotid arteries, which can increase the risk of stroke. The results are available immediately and provide important information for the prevention and treatment of vascular diseases.</p>

                                <p className="mt-2 text-lg leading-8 text-primaryLighter">The leg vein duplex examination is a non-invasive ultrasound procedure used to assess the veins in the legs. It examines both the structure of the veins and the blood flow through them using B-mode ultrasound and Doppler ultrasound. This test aids in the early detection of thrombosis (blood clots) and venous valve diseases.</p>
