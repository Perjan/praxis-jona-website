If you have no credit history, getting approved for a credit card can be challenging. Credit card companies typically rely on credit scores to determine creditworthiness, but without a credit history, you won't have a score. However, there are still options available for those looking to get a credit card without a credit history. 

In this article, we'll discuss some tips and strategies for getting a credit card with no credit history.

### 1\. Apply for a secured credit card
A secured credit card requires a cash deposit that serves as collateral for the credit limit. This type of card can be a good option for those with no credit history, as it helps establish credit and build a credit score.
### 2\. Get added as an authorized user
If you have a friend or family member with good credit, you can ask to be added as an authorized user on their credit card account. This will allow you to use the card and start building a credit history.
### 3\. Apply for a student credit card
Student credit cards are designed for college students who have limited or no credit history. These cards often have lower credit limits and higher interest rates, but they can be a good option for those starting out.
### 4\. Apply for a retail store credit card
Retail store credit cards often have lower credit requirements than traditional credit cards, making them a good option for those with no credit history. However, these cards often come with higher interest rates and limited rewards.
### 5\. Consider a cosigner
If you have a trusted family member or friend with good credit, they may be willing to cosign on a credit card application. This can increase your chances of approval and help you start building a credit history.
