Managing your credit cards in MoneyCoach is extremely easy. Basically it all boils down to:

- Creating a new account with a zero amount for any credit cards that you might have
- Add all your expenses to that account or accounts
- Then at the end of the period when you pay your credit card, just add a transfer transaction from your main account to the credit card to balance everything out.
- Rinse and repeat for the next period and so on.

See, it's easy! Let us know what you think about it.
