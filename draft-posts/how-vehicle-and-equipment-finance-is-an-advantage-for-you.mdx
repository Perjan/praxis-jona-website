**Deducting Interest Related to Debt**

Since the interest that accrues on the loan amount is usually tax-deductible, the overall borrowing cost is lower than the rate of interest. In order to subtract the interest as a business expense, the loan money should be usually used for a business purpose. In addition to this, the business is legally liable to give back the debt and a valid borrower-lender relationship should exist between the parties involved. Additionally, the creditor should completely believe that the amount could be repaid by the business.[![](images/vehicle-and-equipment-finance.jpg)](https://getadvanceinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/vehicle-and-equipment-finance.jpg)
