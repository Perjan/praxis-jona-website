Thanks for accepting to test the syncing architecture and be a pioneer for the new MoneyCoach. **Remember that this version of the app, MoneyCoach Development is a separate version and does not affect the data on your main app**.

### Before Starting To Retest The Apps

Here's how you prepare the environment again:

1. Delete the app from your main and secondary device
2. Delete iCloud data for moneyCoach-dev2 in the iCloud Setting on your device - [here is a guide on how to do so.](https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Apps-from-iCloud) Be careful, the Development version does not have an app icon, it looks like the picture below![](images/IMG_3031.jpg)
3. You are ready to follow the steps from the beginning!

 

Here are two scenarios I would like you to test out:

 

## Scenario 1 - With New Data

### **Phase 1 - Install build 311 from Testflight on your main device**

1. Accept Testflight invite in the email you have received
2. Install Testflight if you haven't already
3. Open Testflight
4. Tap MoneyCoach Dev app (not install!)
5. Scroll to Information and tap Previous Builds >
6. Install **3.9 (311)** version
7. Open MoneyCoach Dev App
8. Skip Onboarding by tapping "I already did this on another device"
9. Now add:
    - 2 accounts
    - 4 random transactions
    - 2 budgets
    - 2 new categories
    - 2 transfers
    - 2 repeating transactions
    - 1 transaction with Payee
10. Go to Settings > Data, turn Cloud Sync ON and select **Backup to Cloud**
11. Wait for it to finish!
12. Close the app and reopen it again
13. Add another random transaction
14. If you have a secondary device like an iPad, move to Phase 2. If not, move to Phase 3

 

### **Phase 2 - Install build 311 from Testflight on your secondary device**

1. Install Testflight if you haven't already
2. Open Testflight
3. Tap MoneyCoach Dev app (not install!)
4. Scroll to Information and tap Previous Builds >
5. Install **3.9 (311**) version
6. Open MoneyCoach Dev App
7. Skip Onboarding by tapping "I already did this on another device"
8. Go to Settings > Data, turn Cloud Sync ON and select **Restore from Cloud**
9. Wait for it to finish
10. Compare the synced data with that of the main device, the data should be synced
11. If it is not synced, [contact us](mailto: info@moneycoach-app.com?Subject=Phase 2 Problem)
12. If it synced correctly, move on to Phase 3.

 

### Phase 3 - Install build 312 from Testflight on your main device

1. Open Testflight
2. Tap MoneyCoach Dev app (not install!)
3. Scroll to Information and tap Previous Builds >
4. Install **3.9 (312)** version
5. After the app opens, you should see the initial migration taking place.
6. Wait for it to fully complete!
7. After this finishes, you should still see all your existing transactions. If you don't see anything but 0, [contact us!](mailto: info@moneycoach-app.com?Subject=Phase 3 Problem 7)
8. If you see your old data, add a new transaction. You should see the indicator next to the Wi-Fi indicator on the status bar spinning!
9. Close the app completely.
10. Open the app, you should see all your transactions plus the newly added one.
11. If you don't see them, [contact us!](mailto: info@moneycoach-app.com?Subject=Phase 3 Problem 11)
12. Close the app completely once again
13. Turn on Airplane mode on your device, no mobile data, no WiFi
14. Open the app
15. You should still see all the transactions. If everything is wrong well, [contact us!](mailto: info@moneycoach-app.com?Subject=Phase 3 Problem 15) If everything is ok, turn Airplane mode OFF.
16. If you have a secondary device, move on to Phase 4. If you only have one device and everything worked like a charm, amazing!

 

### Phase 4 - Install build 312 from Testflight on your secondary device

1. Open Testflight
2. Tap MoneyCoach Dev app (not install!)
3. Scroll to Information and tap Previous Builds >
4. Install **3.9 (312)** version
5. After the app opens, you should see that the migration is taking place.
6. Wait for it to complete
7. After this finishes, you should still see all your existing transactions. If you don't see them [contact us.](mailto: info@moneycoach-app.com?Subject=Phase 4 Problem 7)
8. Add a new transaction
9. Close the app
10. Open your **main device**
11. The new transaction should appear here. The speed will depend based on the internet connection, but it should sync fast. If you don't see it, [contact us.](mailto: info@moneycoach-app.com?Subject=Phase 4 Problem 11)
12. Move on to the final phase!

 

### Final Phase - GO CRAZY

The sync between your devices should be up and running with no problems at all. Now, just go crazy.

- Add new accounts, new transactions, new budgets, delete stuff on both devices and see what happens.
- Turn Airplane Mode ON on one device, add stuff there. At the same time add stuff on your secondary device. Turn Airplane OFF and see what happens, see if the devices sync up.
- Turn Cloud Sync switch OFF, add some stuff then turn if ON once more to see if devices sync.
- Try to break the app(s), but always remember what you do as it is crucial if something wrong happens so that we can replicate and fix it before release.
