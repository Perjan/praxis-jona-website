Technological innovations, such as the internet of things (IoT) and smart devices are reshaping household environments. Nowadays, having a smart home has become not just a trend, but also a necessity. With the help of technology, people are able to have more control over their households and effectively manage their energy consumption. However, the cost of turning your home completely smart is significantly high.

That's why many people are still having doubts about whether turning their home smart is the right decision. Even though smart equipment does require a large investment up front, it can save you a lot of money in the long run. The main reason is that smart devices and the IoT in your home can help you save energy and greatly reduce your bills. Not only that, but they can help your home become more environmentally friendly and green. Here are a few ways investing in a smart home can save you money.

## **Efficient lighting**

Lighting accounts for one of the major energy consumptions in the world. In the U.S. alone, around 129 billion kWh (Kilowatt-hours) is spent on residential lighting. What's more, U.S. citizens spend 6.63 kWh on [Christmas lighting alone](https://phys.org/news/2015-12-christmas-energy-entire-countries.html), which is more than some countries spend in a year. You can greatly reduce your energy consumption and electricity bills by simply switching to LED (Light Emitting Diode) lights or CFL (Compact fluorescent lamps) light bulbs.

As a matter of fact, LED lights can consume anywhere from 25-80% less energy and can last 25 times longer than traditional incandescent bulbs. Moreover, both CFLs and LEDs can reduce light wattage by more than 75%. You can even implement smart systems in your home that will help you manage lighting remotely and help you save energy.

## **Automated control**

One of the best features smart homes have to offer is automation. Forgetting to turn off the light in the bathroom, turn off the stove or forgetting to lock the door is something you wonâ€™t have to worry about anymore. With help of technology, [such as CBus installers](https://www.techontap.com.au/automation/cbus-home-automation-system/) you can connect your smart devices and automate almost every process in your home.

For instance, air conditioning, lighting, security features and more can be regulated via an app on your phone. What's more, an automation system allows you to monitor energy consumption from various devices in your home. That way you can assess the situation and ensure your home is energy efficient. Furthermore, you can automate processes according to your preferences and always maintain an enjoyable environment in your home.

## **Improved security features**

Smart homes offer more security and safety to their owners. Smart devices, such as door locks, window blinds, motion sensors and CCTV surveillance can ensure that your home is secured from intruders. In addition, you can always see what's happening in your home, both indoors and outdoors via live feed on your phone. However, protection against intruders is not the only feature of smart homes.

Moreover, you can also have a [drone patrol your property](http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/sunflower-home-awareness-system/) and alert you to any potential threats. With a smart security system in place, you'll be able to not just prevent threats to your home, but also save money on damage control and repairs.

## **Smarter appliances**

It's no secret that smart household devices cost a lot. However, they are a good investment, especially if you aim to [reduce costs on electricity and energy bills](https://www.cnet.com/news/what-is-the-smart-grid-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) in the long run. Not just that, but smart appliances can also save you a lot of time. For instance, smart refrigerators can adjust cooling based on the number and type of groceries you store in them.

They can also alert you if something is about to expire and can even order new groceries from the store if you program them to do so. Furthermore, smart ovens can be set to cook a meal on their own, while you drive home from work. They can turn off automatically when they detect that the meal is ready. Simply put, smart appliances are more efficient and can save you a lot of money on energy consumption.

Smart homes may cost a lot to implement, but the features that come along will make your life a lot easier. Not only will you be able to have energy efficient and eco-friendly home, but you'll also have a safer place to live.
