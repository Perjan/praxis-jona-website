The automatic sync between your iPhone and Apple Watch is fairly robust, but sometimes even that fails. Normally, it might take a few seconds for the Apple Watch to sync data to your iPhone and vice-versa, but sometimes it may not be working at all.

If that is the case, use this troubleshooting guide:

1\. **Check your Apple Watch connection**

When your devices disconnect, the red iPhone icon or the red X icon appears on your watch face. You can also [check your connection in Control Center](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT206951). When your Apple Watch connects again, the green iPhone icon appears.

2\. **Try to connect your Apple Watch and iPhone again**

- Keep your Apple Watch and paired iPhone close together to make sure that they're in range.
- On your iPhone, make sure that Airplane Mode is off and that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are on. To check, open Control Center
- If you see the Airplane Mode icon on your watch face, Airplane Mode is on. Open Control Center, then turn off Airplane Mode
- Restart your Apple Watch and iPhone

3\. **"Force" sync between your devices**

- Force quit MoneyCoach app on Apple Watch
- Force quit MoneyCoach app on iOS
- Open MoneyCoach on iOS and keep it open
- Open MoneyCoach on Apple Watch
- Scroll down to the bottom of the Overview on Apple Watch using the digital crown and keep scrolling as you hear/feel a haptic feedback
- The "Updated on" line at the end should start updating
- Your data should start syncing between iPhone and Apple Watch
