In MoneyCoach you can easily merge any two or more categories into one. Here's how you do it:

- Go to Settings

- Tap on Categories

- In the Categories screen, tap the ellipsis icon in the lower left side of the screen

- Tap Merge Categories

- In the Merge Tool screen, tap on the "Add category" button

- Here you can select all of the categories you want to be merged into one

- After you select the categories, tap "Done"

- Now tap the "Select destination category"

- Here you can select the category you want all of the previous ones to be merged into

- After you select it, tap "Done"

- Now tap the "Merge" button on the top right side

- Wait and that's it. You just merged multiple categories into one category

You can also merge any subcategories inside a category. Here's how you do it:

- In the Categories screen, find the category that has multiple subcategories inside and tap on it

- Tap on the ellipsis icon in the lower left side of the screen

- Tap Merge Subcategories

- The rest of the process is similar to merging multiple categories into one

- After you have selected what subcategories you want to merge and the destination subcategory, tap the "Merge" button on the top right side

- Wait and that's it. You just merged multiple subscategories into one
