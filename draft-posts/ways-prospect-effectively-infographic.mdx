Sales play a crucial role in bringing in cash flow into the business. Without it, a startup or business cannot sustain its daily operations and would eventually fail.

One of the most important and initial steps in sales is prospecting â€“ which is the process of qualifying the leads who have demonstrated the desire to make a purchase decision. This step is pivotal in closing deals and as such, must be executed on time and properly to ensure success. In fact, statistics say that the first viable vendor to reach a decision maker has a 74% chance to win the deal if they manage to set the buying vision.
